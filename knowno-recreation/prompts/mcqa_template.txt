You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers,
a top one and a middle one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

- Options must be specific, executable next steps for the given situation.
- Exactly ONE option should be the best next step; the other three should be plausible/likely.
- Format EXACTLY:
A. <option one>
B. <option two>
C. <option three>
D. <option four>
E. An option not listed here.

*NOTE: An option not listed here should NOT always be E. It should be randomized with the other answers.
